# Blooming Flower Night Light using ESP8226

Inspiration for the adjusted code is the original [3D Print This Blooming Flower Night Light](https://makezine.com/projects/3d-print-this-blooming-flower-night-light/) project. The original arduino based code can be found [here](https://github.com/ossum/bloomingossumlamp). This version is heavily adjusted to work with a ESP8266 - in my case a Wemos D1 Mini. In addition the it uses a WiFi manager and MQTT client to be controllable by the outside world.
